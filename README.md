# commit-sign-test

Testing my commits get signed. Has this worked?

Now checking WSL2...

Did not work. Using SSH keys.

Troubleshooting further...

Reinstalled GCM

Changed credential helper...

Added identity.

Trying different terminal

Tried new gpg pckg

Now opening in a regular window rather than wsl.

New gpg key...
